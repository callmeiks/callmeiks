🛠️ **About Agentfy**  
[Agentfy](https://github.com/Agentfy-io/Agentfy) is a modular, multi-agent coordination system purpose-built for automating tasks across social media ecosystems.  
Architected with a flexible **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, it enables intelligent workflow execution by leveraging LLMs to translate user intents into structured, goal-driven task chains — no manual configuration needed.

Agentfy supports multi-agent communication and collaboration, allowing sub-agents to reason, perceive, and act together in real-time. It dynamically selects and routes requests to the most suitable agents and functions for maximum efficiency.
